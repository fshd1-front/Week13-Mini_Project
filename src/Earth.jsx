        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
        known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the
        only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all
        of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of
        Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of
        which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's
        land hemisphere.
