        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is
        orange-red because it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the
        nickname "the Red Planet".[22][23] Mars is among the brightest objects
        in Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a
        common subject for telescope viewing. It is classified as a terrestrial
        planet and is the second smallest of the Solar System's planets with a
        diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital motion, a Martian
        solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours, and a Martian solar year is
        equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days). Mars has two natural
        satellites that are small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos.
